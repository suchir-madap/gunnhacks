This project asks the user to input a zip code, and the program will determine different weather conditions in that area, such as temperature. The color of the game board is based off the temperature in that area (ex: If it is cold, the board will be blue. If it is hot, the board will be orange). On that board, there will be a snake which the user controls with their arrow keys or WASD. It tries to eat the apple, and for each apple eaten the snake becomes longer. The score is based off the number of apples eaten, but if the snake collides, the game ends.
